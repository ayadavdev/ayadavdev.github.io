About JSON
JSON, short for JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight computer data interchange format. JSON is a text-based, human-readable format for representing simple data structures and associative arrays (called objects).

In JSON, they take on the following forms: object, array, value, string and number.

Slow loading speed
Several users reported slow loading speed in Chrome, but I couldn't figure out why. If you have any hints, please get in touch.

I've done some tests and looks like Firefox loading speed is fine, so please try using that until we figure this out. Thx!

Security concerns:
- The JSON code entered by our users is not saved on the server. In fact, the site doesn't even have a database
- Our site uses HTTPS, so all the traffic between the client and our server is encrypted
- Our service has been running since 2008 and is trusted by more than 500,000 users every month

For any questions or problems please get in touch
